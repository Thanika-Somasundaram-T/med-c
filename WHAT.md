# What am i gonna do?

# data of hospitals
	what treatment do they give?
	filter:
		location?
		ratings?
		price?
	doctor
	doctor profile

# Express js

					profile
				in/out patient record
	book appointment
		show slots available
		methods of booking
			by call
			schedule

# frontend =>
# React js
	
# header
# nav bar =>
	about us
	collaborate
	help

# body
# search bar (technically a drop down list)
# list of hospitals
# hospital profile
# doctor's profile
# book appointment
# track backwards


**I think this makes a base for this website module. This will be fit for mini project. However, this mobile app relates well with this idea. As I don't have any clue about mobile app I'm doing this on React js as frontend and Express js as backend with FireBase as database.I hope this comes out well.**
